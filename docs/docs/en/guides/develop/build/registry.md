# Registry {#registry}

> [!WARNING] BETA
> This feature is currently in beta. If you encounter any issues, please report them at our <LocalizedLink href="https://community.tuist.dev/c/troubleshooting-how-to/6">community forum</LocalizedLink>.

> [!IMPORTANT] REMOTE PROJECT REQUIRED
> This feature requires a <LocalizedLink href="/server/introduction/accounts-and-projects">remote project</LocalizedLink>.

As the number of dependencies grows, so does the time to resolve them. While other package managers like [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are centralized, Swift Package Manager is not. Because of that, SwiftPM needs to resolve dependencies by doing a deep clone of each repository, which can be time-consuming. To address this, Tuist provides an implementation of the [Package Registry](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/PackageRegistry/PackageRegistryUsage.md), so you can download only the commit you _actually need_. If the package is in the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/), it's also in the Tuist Registry.

## Usage {#usage}

To set up and login to the registry, `cd` into your project's directory and run:

```bash
tuist registry setup
tuist registry login
```

Now you can access the registry! To resolve dependencies from the registry instead of from source control, follow the section below based on your setup.

> [!NOTE] AUTHENTICATION ON THE CI
> To log in to the registry on the CI, ensure that a <LocalizedLink href="/server/introduction/authentication#as-a-project">project token</LocalizedLink> is present. Otherwise, run the same `registry login` command as you would locally.

### Xcode projects {#xcode-projects}

### Tuist project with the Xcode default integration {#tuist-project-with-xcode-default-integration}

### Tuist project with the XcodeProj-based integration {#tuist-project-with-xcodeproj-based-integration}

If you are using the <LocalizedLink href="/guides/develop/projects/dependencies#tuists-xcodeprojbased-integration">XcodeProj-based integration</LocalizedLink>, you can use the ``--replace-scm-with-registry`` flag to resolve dependencies from the registry if they are available. Add it to the `installOptions` in your `Tuist.swift` file:
```swift
import ProjectDescription

let tuist = Tuist(
    fullHandle: "{account-handle}/{project-handle}",
    project: .tuist(
        installOptions: .options(passthroughSwiftPackageManagerArguments: ["--replace-scm-with-registry"])
    )
)
```

If you want to ensure that the registry is used every time you resolve dependencies, you will need to update `dependencies` in your `Tuist/Package.swift` file to use the registry identifier instead of a URL. The registry identifier is always in the form of `{organization}.{repository}`. For example, to use the registry for the `swift-composable-architecture` package, do the following:
```diff
dependencies: [
-   .package(url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture", from: "0.1.0")
+   .package(id: "pointfreeco.swift-composable-architecture", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

### Swift package {#swift-package}

If you are working on a Swift package, you can use the `--replace-scm-with-registry` flag to resolve dependencies from the registry if they are available:

```bash
swift package --replace-scm-with-registry resolve
```

If you want to ensure that the registry is used every time you resolve dependencies, you will need to update `dependencies` in your `Package.swift` file to use the registry identifier instead of a URL. The registry identifier is always in the form of `{organization}.{repository}`. For example, to use the registry for the `swift-composable-architecture` package, do the following:
```diff
dependencies: [
-   .package(url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture", from: "0.1.0")
+   .package(id: "pointfreeco.swift-composable-architecture", from: "0.1.0")
]
```
